            <p>Hello, my name is Alem I hold a BA in International Security and Conflict Resolution (ISCOR) with an emphasis in economics from SDSU. After completing my BA I pursed a MA in Economics but half way through found a love for coding and decided to make change of direction in what I wanted to pursue. I have been teaching myself to code for the past year through many online tutorials and classes that I can find. I decided on focusing on javascript as the programming language I wanted to learn because of the potential it has in the future, also not to mention that it is the language of the web and can now be used on the server-side with nodeJS.</p>
